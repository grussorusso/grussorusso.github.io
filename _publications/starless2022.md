Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is increasingly popular
thanks to the benefits provided to application developers and operators. Besides commercial Cloud-based offerings, open-source
solutions have emerged enabling FaaS deployment on private
infrastructures and possibly at the edge of the network. When
moving from the Cloud to Fog/Edge environments, optimizing
resource allocation for function execution becomes a critical
challenge. Unfortunately, existing FaaS platforms have little or no
support for fine-grained scheduling and resource allocation, nor
allow users to enforce Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. We
take a first step towards the development of a QoS-aware FaaS
platform. We design and implement new mechanisms to support
differentiated classes of services within Apache OpenWhisk, a
popular open-source FaaS framework. Our experiments show
that our prototype efficiently supports state-of-the-art scheduling
policies and provides throughput improvements when dealing
with function compositions under high load scenarios.
