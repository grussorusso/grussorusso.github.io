In the academic year 2022/23, I teach the following courses:

- *Fundamentals of Programming and Data Analytics*, 3 out of 9 ECTS (BSc in
Aeronautics Engineering), at Roma Tre University 
- *Hands-on Cloud Computing Services*, supplementary course (10 hours) (MSc
in Computer Science), at University of Rome Tor Vergata

In June 2023, I held 4 lectures (10 hours) for a doctoral course on
*"Model-free and Model-based Auto-Scaling Techniques for Distributed
Applications"* at Roma Tre University (slides: 
[Part 1](/slides/RL-Roma3-1.pdf), [Part 2](/slides/RL-Roma3-2.pdf)).
