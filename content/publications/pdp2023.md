The Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) paradigm is increasingly adopted for the development of Cloud-native applications, which especially benefit from the seamless scalability
and attractive pricing models of serverless deployments. With
the continuous emergence of latency-sensitive applications and
services, including Internet-of-Things and augmented reality, it
is now natural to wonder whether and how the FaaS paradigm
can be efficiently exploited in the Cloud-Edge Continuum, where
serverless functions may benefit from reduced network delay
between their invoking users and the FaaS platform.

In this paper, we illustrate the key challenges that must be
faced to effectively deploy serverless functions in the Cloud-Edge Continuum and review recent contributions proposed by
the research community towards overcoming those challenges.
We also discuss the key issues that currently remain unsolved
and highlight a few research opportunities for better support of
FaaS in the Compute Continuum.
