The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence applications to analyze data generated by Internet of Things sensors
leads to the development of the edge computing paradigm.
Deploying applications at the periphery of the network effectively addresses cost and latency concerns associated with
cloud computing. However, it generates a highly distributed
environment with heterogeneous devices, opening the challenges of how to select resources and place application com-
ponents. Starting from a state-of-the-art design-time tool, we
present in this paper a novel framework based on Reinforcement Learning, named FIGARO (reinForcement learnInG
mAnagement acRoss the computing cOntinuum). It handles
the runtime adaptation of a computing continuum environment, dealing with the variability of the incoming load and
service times. To reduce the training time, we exploit the
design-time knowledge, achieving a significant reduction in
the violations of the response time constraint.
