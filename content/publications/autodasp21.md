An increasing number of data-driven applications rely on the ability of
processing data flows in a timely manner, exploiting for this purpose Data
Stream Processing~(DSP) systems. Elasticity is an essential feature for DSP
systems, as workload variability calls for automatic scaling of the application
processing capacity, to avoid both overload and resource wastage. In this work,
we implement auto-scaling in Pulsar Functions, a function-based streaming
framework built on top of Apache Pulsar. The latter is is a distributed
publish-subscribe messaging platform that natively supports serverless
functions. Considering various state-of-the-art policies, we show that the
proposed solution is able to scale application parallelism with minimal
overhead.
