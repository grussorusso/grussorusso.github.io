In this paper, we present a solution to the DEBS 2022 Grand Challenge (GC). According to the GC requirements, the proposed software continuously observes notifications about financial instruments being traded, aiming to timely detect breakout patterns. Our solution leverages Apache Flink, an open-source, scalable stream processing platform, which allows us to process incoming data streams with low latency and exploit the parallelism offered by the underlying computing infrastructure.
