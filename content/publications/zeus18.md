Data Stream Processing applications can process large data volumes in near
real-time. In order to face varying workloads in a scalable and cost-effective
manner, it is critical to adjust the application parallelism at run-time. We
formulate the elasticity problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). As the MDP
resolution requires full knowledge of the system dynamics, which is rarely
available, we rely on model based Reinforcement Learning to improve the scaling
policy at run-time. We show promising results even for a decentralized approach,
       compared tothe optimal MDP solution.
