Modern computing environments are evolving towards the compute continuum paradigm, which promises to manage the heterogeneity and dynamism of geographically spread computing resources, supporting the execution of distributed and pervasive applications. As a complete understanding of all the implications and challenges posed by this new paradigm is still far, we give an overview of the key features and concepts of the compute continuum and discuss the most relevant research opportunities we envision in the field.
