### Serverledge

A Function-as-a-Service framework designed for Edge-Cloud environments, 
[presented at *IEEE PerCom
'23*](https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOM56429.2023.10099372).
Serverledge relies on a decentralized architecture, with no centralized 
gateways for function invocations, and supports horizontal and vertical
function execution offloading.
Written in Go.
