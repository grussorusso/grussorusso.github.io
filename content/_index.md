I am a Research Associate at the *Department of Engineering* of
Roma Tre University.
Previously, I was a Research Associate at the *Department of Civil Engineering and Computer
Science Engineering* of the
University of Rome Tor Vergata, where I received my PhD degree in
May 2021.


My research interests span the area of distributed computing systems with emphasis on
Quality-of-Service optimization and run-time self-adaptation.
My current research mainly revolves around:

- Function-as-a-Service in the Edge-Cloud Continuum
- Performance optimization for Big Data processing systems
- Workflow scheduling in the Cloud
- Self-adaptive Data Stream Processing (DSP) systems
