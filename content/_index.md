I am a Research Fellow at the *Department of Civil Engineering and Computer
Science Engineering* of the
[University of Rome Tor Vergata](https://web.uniroma2.it/en), where I am part of the
[DAMON](http://www.ce.uniroma2.it) research group.

<!--
Previously, I was a PostDoc researcher at
Roma Tre University.
Previously, I was a Research Associate at the *Department of Civil Engineering and Computer
Science Engineering* of the
University of Rome Tor Vergata, where I received my PhD degree in
May 2021.

My research interests span the area of distributed computing systems with emphasis on
performance optimization and run-time self-adaptation.
My current research mainly revolves around:

- Serverless computing in the Edge-Cloud Continuum
- Scheduling and resource allocation for data-intensive systems
